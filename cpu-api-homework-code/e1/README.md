## What value is the variable in the child process?
The value of the variable in the child process has the same value as the variable in the parent process.
## What happens to the variable when both the child and parent change the value of x?
If x is set to another value, the change will only apply to its respective Virtual Address Space in memory. Both parent process and child process have their own memory space and neither interfere with each other.
